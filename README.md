#  **AWS EC2-Based Web Application Architecture Documentation**



##  **Project Overview**

This architecture represents a **highly available, fault-tolerant, and cost-optimized EC2-based web application deployment** on AWS. It leverages multiple AWS services such as EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, RDS, CloudWatch, SNS, and IAM to ensure scalability, reliability, observability, and secure access.



## **1. AWS Global Infrastructure Layer**

### 1.1. **AWS Cloud**

* The top-level boundary that houses all AWS services globally.
* This architecture is designed within a single **Region** to reduce latency and comply with data residency requirements.

### 1.2. **Region**

* A region is a physical location worldwide where AWS clusters data centers.
* Example used: `us-east-1` or `eu-west-1`.



##  **2. Networking Layer (VPC and Subnets)**

### 2.1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**

* A logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud.
* Custom **CIDR block**: e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`
* Contains both public and private subnets across **multiple Availability Zones**.

### 2.2. **Availability Zones**

* Two zones are used: **AZ-A and AZ-B**.
* This ensures **high availability** and **fault tolerance** across geographically separated data centers.

### 2.3. **Subnets**

| Subnet Type    | Placement  | Purpose                                               |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Public Subnet  | AZ-A, AZ-B | Houses ALB and EC2 (frontend), allows internet access |
| Private Subnet | AZ-A, AZ-B | Houses RDS instances and private EC2 (backend)        |



## **3. Compute Layer**

### 3.1. **EC2 Instances**

* Deployed in **Public Subnets** across both AZs.
* Run the web application.
* Configured with **IAM roles**, **Security Groups**, and optionally **User Data scripts** for bootstrapping.

### 3.2. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

* Automatically adjusts EC2 instances based on demand (CPU, memory, or custom metrics).
* Ensures **elasticity**, **cost optimization**, and **availability**.
* Min: 2 | Max: 6 | Desired: 2 (example).



## **4. Load Balancing & Traffic Management**

### 4.1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

* Deployed in **Public Subnets**.
* Accepts inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet.
* Distributes traffic across EC2 instances in multiple AZs.
* **Health checks** monitor instance health.



## ðŸ’¾ **5. Database Layer**

### 5.1. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**

* Multi-AZ deployment for **high availability** and **automated failover**.
* Deployed in **Private Subnets**.
* MySQL/PostgreSQL engine with automatic backups and monitoring.
* Security Group allows access only from EC2 instances within the VPC.


## **6. Security & Access Management**

### 6.1. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

* EC2 instances and RDS are assigned **IAM roles** with least privilege access.
* Example policies:

  * EC2 can write to **CloudWatch Logs**
  * RDS can integrate with **IAM authentication**

### 6.2. **Security Groups**

| Resource | Inbound Rules                       | Outbound Rules                |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ALB      | HTTP/HTTPS from `0.0.0.0/0`         | Forward to EC2                |
| EC2      | HTTP from ALB SG, SSH from admin IP | To RDS, Internet (via NAT)    |
| RDS      | MySQL/PostgreSQL from EC2 SG        | Deny all (no internet access) |



## **7. Monitoring & Alerting**

### 7.1. **CloudWatch**

* Monitors EC2 health, CPU usage, memory, and disk.
* Captures logs and custom metrics.
* Triggers alarms on threshold breaches.

### 7.2. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**

* Sends **email or SMS alerts** based on CloudWatch alarms (e.g., high CPU, unhealthy EC2).
* Ensures timely intervention and resolution.



##  **8. Cost Optimization Measures**

* **Auto Scaling** ensures resources match demand, reducing idle costs.
* Use of **multi-AZ RDS** only when necessary.
* Reserved or Spot Instances can be introduced to optimize EC2 billing.
* CloudWatch metrics help eliminate over-provisioned resources.



## **9. High Availability and Fault Tolerance**

| Layer         | Mechanism                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Compute       | Auto Scaling + AZ redundancy              |
| Database      | Multi-AZ RDS                              |
| Load Balancer | Cross-AZ ALB                              |
| Subnets       | Split across AZs                          |
| Monitoring    | CloudWatch + SNS alerts for auto-recovery |



## **10. Deployment and Maintenance Practices**

* Infrastructure can be provisioned via **CloudFormation** or **Terraform**.
* **CI/CD** pipelines can be integrated via AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions.
* **SSM (Systems Manager)** can replace direct SSH for better security.
* Resources are tagged for ownership, billing, and lifecycle management.


Here's a **concise deployment guide** for the EC2-based architecture:



##  Concise Deployment Steps: EC2-Based Web App with ALB, ASG & RDS



### ðŸ”¹ **1. Networking**

* **Create a VPC**

  * With 2 public and 2 private subnets across **AZ A** and **AZ B**
* **Add Internet Gateway**

  * Attach to VPC
* **Create Route Tables**

  * Public subnets â†’ route to internet via IGW
  * Private subnets â†’ default route (NAT if needed)



### ðŸ”¹ **2. Security & IAM**

* **Create IAM Role** for EC2 (e.g., allow access to S3, CloudWatch)
* **Create Security Groups**

  * ALB SG: Allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS
  * EC2 SG: Allow ALB access (port 80/443), outbound to DB
  * RDS SG: Allow EC2 access (port 3306 for MySQL)


### ðŸ”¹ **3. Compute**

* **Launch Template or Config** for EC2

  * Amazon Linux / Ubuntu
  * Install web app stack (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
* **Create Auto Scaling Group**

  * Use EC2 Launch Template
  * Distribute across AZ A and B
  * Attach **Application Load Balancer**

  * Health checks configured



### ðŸ”¹ **5. Database**

* **Launch Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ)**

  * Configure parameter group, subnet group
  * Set appropriate security group



### ðŸ”¹ **6. Monitoring & Alerts**

* **Enable CloudWatch Logs & Metrics**

  * E.g., High CPU, unhealthy hosts
* **Create SNS Topic**
